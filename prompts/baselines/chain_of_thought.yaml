  Given a Context and a Question, you will extract relevant clauses using step-by-step reasoning.

  IMPORTANT: If you are uncertain whether a clause is relevant, INCLUDE IT.
  It is better to extract a potentially relevant clause than to miss one.
  Only respond "No related clause" if you have thoroughly searched and found nothing.

  Context:
  {contract_text}

  Question:
  {question}

  Let's think step by step:

  1. First, identify the key concepts in the Question
  2. Scan the Context for sentences containing these concepts
  3. For each potential match, evaluate if it directly addresses the Question
  4. Extract the exact text of relevant sentences (do not rephrase)
  5. Provide your final answer

  After your reasoning, provide your final extraction.
  If no relevant clauses found, respond with "No related clause."
